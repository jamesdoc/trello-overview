# Trello Overview

Do you have that problem of having a multiple team members on multiple projects over multiple Trello boards? Yup, me too.

Trello Overview is a simple tool to give you a quick overview of what your team is working on right now. Give it boards you want it to keep an eye on, and the lists to pull cards from and it will merge the lists into one virtual board.

Nb: This isn't meant to replace Trello UI, instead just a quick overview of what is happening across multiple boards.
